# 📚 Python Data Structures & Function Practice

This week's focus was to strengthen understanding of **lists**, **tuples**, and **functions** through hands-on problem solving.  
I solved problems based on nested data, tuple operations, and writing custom logic inside Python functions.

## 🧠 Tasks Covered

### ✅ Task 4 - List Manipulations
- Combine two lists index-wise
- Add item after specific value in a nested list
- Extend sublists with new items
- Replace elements deep inside nested structures

### ✅ Task 5 - Tuple Operations
- Join tuples with similar starting elements
- Multiply adjacent elements in a tuple and store combined results

### ✅ Task 6 - Functions
- Return only unique elements from a list
- Sort hyphen-separated words alphabetically
- Count uppercase and lowercase letters in a string
